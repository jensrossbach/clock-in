# ClockIn v3.2
Welcome to ClockIn, the time manager for notifying you about your working time.

## What is ClockIn?
ClockIn captures the time you're at work and notifies you when you've reached
your regular working time, when you're approaching your maximum working time and
finally when you've reached your maximum working time. It applies certain rules
for break periods and lets you specify any absence periods during the day.

## Usage
ClockIn can start automatically when you boot your PC and remains silently in
the background. The first application start on a day is treated as start of your
working time. You can manually correct this if it deviates too much from the
actual time of clock in. To open the main window of the application, double
click on the icon in the system tray or press the hotkey you've defined.
